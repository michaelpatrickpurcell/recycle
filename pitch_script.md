Permutations is a lightweight game that combines satisfying, snappy card play with the suspense and excitement of sealed-bid auctions.
The best part is, it's always your turn!

During the game, you'll play through three rounds.
Each round consists of a series of auctions.

Let's give it a try.
Place your bids!

What card will you bid with?
High bidders get to collect their cards first.
But be careful!
The cards you bid with in each auction become the pool for the next.
You'll want to try to set yourself up for the next auction while you bid in this one. 

Now that the bids are in, it's time to collect.
Which card do you want?
Your score depends on the colours and icons on the cards you collect.
Also, you will use the cards you collect now to make your bids during the next round.
Naturally, however, the highest-scoring cards are the worst for winning future auctions.

So, will you take a star card for guaranteed points now?
Or, will you take a high card for future bidding power?
Can you take a card that will also help you build high-scoring colour sets?

Choose wisely!
To win the game, you'll need to strike the perfect balance to score big while you stick it to your opponents.
